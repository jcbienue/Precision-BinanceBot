Sure! Here's a **step-by-step tutorial** to create a simple **multi-screen navigation app** in **MIT App Inventor**. This example will include two screens: a **Main Menu** and an **About Page**.

---

## **Project: Multi-Screen Navigation App**

### **Goal:**  
Create an app with two screens. The main screen has a button that opens a second screen ("About"), and the second screen has a button to go back.

---

### **Step 1: Create a New Project**
1. Go to [appinventor.mit.edu](https://appinventor.mit.edu/)
2. Click **Create Apps** and log in.
3. Click **Start new project**, name it `MultiScreenApp`.

---

### **Step 2: Design Screen1 (Main Screen)**

1. **Rename Screen1** (optional, but good practice): Keep it as `Screen1`.
2. Drag and drop a **Label** and name it:  
   - **Text**: “Welcome to My App”
   - **Font Size**: 25
   - **Text Alignment**: Center
3. Drag a **Button** below the label:
   - **Text**: “Go to About Page”
   - Rename it: `btnGoToAbout`

---

### **Step 3: Add a Second Screen**
1. Click **“Add Screen”** at the top of the interface.
2. Name it `Screen2`.

---

### **Step 4: Design Screen2 (About Page)**
1. Drag a **Label**:
   - **Text**: “This is the About Page.”
   - **Font Size**: 20
   - **Text Alignment**: Center
2. Drag a **Button**:
   - **Text**: “Back to Home”
   - Rename it: `btnBackHome`

---

### **Step 5: Add Blocks to Screen1**
1. Go to the **Blocks** tab in `Screen1`.
2. Click on the button (`btnGoToAbout`) and drag the **when btnGoToAbout.Click** block.
3. Add the block:
   - `open another screen` (found under **Control**).
   - Text block with `"Screen2"` (found under **Text**).

```blocks
when btnGoToAbout.Click
  open another screen screenName "Screen2"
```

---

### **Step 6: Add Blocks to Screen2**
1. Go to the **Blocks** tab in `Screen2`.
2. Click on the button (`btnBackHome`) and drag the **when btnBackHome.Click** block.
3. Add the block:
   - `close screen` (under **Control**).

```blocks
when btnBackHome.Click
  close screen
```

> This will return the user to the previous screen (Screen1).

---

### **Step 7: Test Your App**
1. Use the **AI2 Companion App** on your Android device or emulator.
2. Scan the QR code to test.
3. Click the “Go to About Page” button — it should take you to Screen2.
4. Click “Back to Home” — it should return to Screen1.

---

### **Optional Enhancements**
- Add more screens (e.g., Help, Settings).
- Pass data between screens.
- Use screen transitions for better UX.
